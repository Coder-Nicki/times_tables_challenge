## Overview
This terminal application allows users to practise their multiplication skills and to race to complete all the levels in time to be crowned the champion. This app is aimed at students of all ages looking to improve their skills in this mathematical ability.

## Features

The first feature of this application is 'Game Mode'. Users start at level one and have to answer multiplication sums correctly in order to move up to the next level. However, if they get too many wrong, or take too long to answer them, then they are out of the game. There are 10 levels that all increase in difficulty. Can you be named the champion and complete all levels successfully?

The second feature is the 'Practice Mode'. Users can choose out of 3 difficulty levels to practise. The levels are easy, medium and hard. During the practise time, the correct and incorrect answers are recorded. The time is also recorded so the user knows how long it took them to answer so many questions. Each practice level has a limit of 100 questions, before they are automatically exited from that mode. The user is also able to exit whenever they like by pressing 'q'.

Time is a key feature of both modes. The time taken to answer questions is recorded and then printed back to the user.
