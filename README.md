# timesTable Challenge

## Overview

## Features

The first feature of this application is 'Game Mode'. Users start at level one and have to answer multiplication sums correctly in order to move up to the next level. However, if they get too many wrong, then they are out of the game. There are 10 levels that all increase in difficulty. Can you be named the champion and complete all levels successfully?
